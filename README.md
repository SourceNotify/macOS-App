## What is Source Notify
Source Notify is a software that allows you to control your Pull Request status directly from your Desktop menu bar. Built with passion specially for those who work with <b>Git Clients<b/>.
  
  You can have connected at the same time one account for <b>Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket<b/>. Doing this and by default will fetch your <b>Personal<b/> Repositories (Public and Private) from your Repositories List. You are able to choose what repositories you want to see the Pull Requests from, you are able to choose between four options <b>Personal, Starred, Personal&Starred and Filtered</b>.
  
  Filtered Repositories allows you to choose what Repositories yo want to fecth instead of getting all the default Repositories in the Personal/Starred list. One thing you must pay attention is that you need to have read access to that Repository, otherwise the app will show you an error and will not fetch any repositories from the clients.
